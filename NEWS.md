# modeltime 0.0.1.9000 (Development Version)

### Confidence Interval Estimation

- `modeltime_forecast()`: Now estimates confidence intervals using centered standard deviation. The mean is assumed to be zero and residuals deviate from mean = 0. 

### Fixes

- Updates to work with `parsnip` 0.1.2.
- `prophet_boost()`: Set `nthreads = 1` (default) to ensure parallelization is thread safe.
